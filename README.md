# JavaDriverTestFramework
 Java Driver Framework for JavaFX UI Testing



This is a POM-based framework with TEST NG and Cucumber along with Extent Reports used for JavaFX GUI testing. The Framework accepts the path to Jar file as URL and automates the GUI application.

Note : There are limitations with respect to accessing UI elements, as it only supports native JavaFX elements and limited support for other derived JavaFX frameworks.
